				<p>Dental implants provide several advantages over other teeth replacement options. In addition to looking and functioning like natural teeth, they are more comfortable and stable than conventional dentures, allowing you to retain a more natural biting and chewing capacity.</p>
<p>In addition, because implant-supported full bridges and dentures will replace some of your tooth roots, your bone is better preserved. With conventional dentures, the bone that previously surrounded the tooth roots begins to resorb resulting in poor retention and stability of your dentures. Dental implants integrate with your jawbone, helping to keep the bone healthy and intact.</p>
<p>In the long term, implants can be more esthetic and easier to maintain than conventional dentures. The loss of bone that accompanies conventional dentures leads to recession of the jawbone and a collapsed, unattractive smile. Conventional dentures make it difficult to eat certain foods.</p>
<p>In FMS DENTAL HOSPITAL, the  number of people getting full mouth dental rehabilitation / reconstruction with dental implant is increasing constantly in the last decade. This is due to increased quality in high expertise of our dentists and the low cost compared to implant treatment in other countries. We do our standard diagnostic procedures involving thorough clinical examination , documentation of the case (digital photos and videos), diagnostic mock ups, digital CBCT (3D imaging scan), virtual planning, smile designing and prepare a thorough plan to determine that our patient is indeed an ideal candidate to get much improved and better quality of life from full mouth implant treatment </p>
<p>Full mouth dental implant procedure is indicated in 2 situation:<br>
(1)	When the patient has lost all the teeth before itself due to periodontal disease or decay<br>
(2)	When the patient lost most of the existing teeth and remaining teeth are having poor prognosis.<br>
In the 2nd condition , it is better to proceed with extraction of all the remaining week teeth and to replace with full mouth dental implants and fixed bridge. Trying to save few poor/weak teeth with flap surgeries or by root canal treatment will only add expenses, more dentist visits with no real benefit to the patients.The full mouth rehabilitation with dental implants is scientifically documented successful procedure with success rate above 97%.</p>
<p>Benefits Of Fixed Teeth With Full Mouth Dental Implants:<br>
◦	Permits you to eat and operate like having natural teeth.<br>
◦	Maintains facial appearance and averts bone loss.<br>
◦	Difficult to find out from natural teeth.<br>
◦	 90% of chewing efficiency is restored.<br>
◦	 No window period as these  implants are Immediate loading, as entire procedure (removal of all remaining teeth, placement of all implants and getting fixed teeth) in 3-5 days<br>
There are many brands of implants available and the dental implant cost in FMS dental hospital primarily depends on the quality of the product, number of implants, the need for bone grafting and how many teeth we end up putting. Some of the standard implant brands we use include Nobel Biocare, Nobel Active, Alpha Bio.</p>
<p>A Full mouth implant treatment consists of:<br>
(1)	The diagnosis and planning stages<br>
(2)	The surgical stage will include extraction of teeth, placement of all  6-8 implants per arch, grafting procedures etc.<br>
(3)	Fabrication of fixed temporary bridges, usually made of hybrid acrylic material which will be fixed within 3 days<br>
(4)	Durable, natural looking ceramic teeth are fixed to these implants after complete healing,  which is usually done  after 6-8months<br>
The extent of the treatment process can depend on individual condition and preferences. Modern technology allows us to place fixed temporary bridges on the implants within 3 days of implants placement. This technology provides a very easy and quick transition from bad teeth to a beautiful smile. The final, permanent implants bridges made of ceramic will fully restore function and comfort.<br>
 Cleaning of fixed full mouth implant bridges is same as natural teeth. By brushing, flossing, using water pick and with  regular dental visits can easily maintain their new teeth.<br>
We provide all our full mouth implant patients with night guards. A night guard is a plastic appliance worn at night to keep the upper and lower teeth from touching each other. These are especially important for patients with a history of clenching or grinding teeth ( bruxism). </p>
<p>Dental implant has revolutionised in the field of dentistry. It is currently the best choice and ideal method to replace a single or multiple missing teeth. This treatment helps to bring back your appearance, comfort and function compared to that of healthy natural teeth. Full mouth implants replaces all the teeth in either jaw or both. Although a greater number of implants, such as 6 or 8 is ideal for replacing all teeth in a single jaw, fixed teeth with full mouth implants can also be done with a minimum of only 4 implants in single jaw also. This concept is called as All on 4 concept. It is along lasting treatment solution that provides permanent fixed artificial teeth, especially for patients who are uncomfortable wearing removable dentures. This procedure is much more comfortable and secure than the regular conventional dentures that allow you to hold a better natural biting and chewing ability. </p>
<p>The All on 4 concept- Replaces all our teeth immediately. It allows the teeth to be fixed immediately over the full mouth implants. This is a permanent treatment and the teeth can be given immediately, within 3 days, after placing the implants without the requirement for waiting for a long healing period. These immediate teeth are usually hybrid acrylic which can be used up to an year. Later the teeth alone can be changed to ceramic teeth without disturbing implants.</p>
<p>The key to success of full mouth dental implants is in meticulous treatment planning. Proper selection and positioning or placement of each implants will determine the success and durability of the final prosthesis. In FMS DENTAL HOSPITAL, we are equipped with in house cone beam CT. With the help of CBCT of  jaws, our implantologists will do virtual planning of the surgery, plan the position and size of implants. Every patient is unique and requires careful planning. Our implantologists will make the final plan on the best choice of implants and type of teeth after correlating the clinical examination with CBCT findings. </p>
