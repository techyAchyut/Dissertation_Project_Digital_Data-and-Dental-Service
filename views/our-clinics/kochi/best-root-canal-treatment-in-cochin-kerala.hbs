				<p>Root canal treatment is one of the most challenging treatments for a dentist to perform. There are many risks and possible causes of problems when performing a root canal treatment, and accurate measurements, correct instrumentation and bacteria control is vital to ensuring a good result.</p>
<p>Root canal treatment can be very complex and is a time consuming procedure, and in some difficult cases it is best to see a specialist endodontist straight away. This is because the success of a root canal treatment being carried out for the first time is much higher than the second time and if it is not done to a high standard, there is a risk of the root canal treatment failing. If this happens, there is a need for a re-root canal treatment. Unfortunately, the success rates of re-root canal treatments are much lower, hence it is important to get it completed correctly the first time.</p>
<p>At FMS, we also have a specialist endodontist  who has many years of experience and has completed post graduate education solely in endodontics. At FMS  we make sure that the risk of failure is minimised by using best practice techniques and high tech equipment to locate the ends of the roots, ensuring the filling reaches the whole length of the root canal. We have also invested in specially designed microscope  for a much clearer and enlarged vision of the very small root canal openings.<br>
We anaesthetize the tooth fully to ensure that the treatment is carried out comfortably, without the much-dreaded root canal pain.</p>
<p>We then isolate the tooth, usually with a rubber dam, to ensure that the field is kept as sterile as possible and new bacteria contamination of the tooth by saliva is avoided. Maintaining a moisture-free, sterile environment when performing a root canal treatment is important as this prevents any bacteria in the mouth from entering the canals.</p>
<p>Our root canal specialist  then uses modern flexible titanium Protaper files to ensure that the canals are shaped efficiently. We only use our files once, in order to minimise the risk of fracture and reduce the risk of cross infection.</p>
<p>We use high tech electronic apex locators to establish the length of canals accurately and to reduce the number of radiographs and hence radiographic dosage. We thoroughly clean the canals with powerful disinfectants such as sodium hypochlorite with EndoVac which helps in irrigation of the canal and occasionally iodine to destroy any remaining bacteria inside the canals.</p>
<p>We also use top of the range equipment when placing the filling material, in certain cases â€“ the hot shot and hot tip from smart endodontics. Our root canal specialist in FMS is fully trained and experienced in using this advanced equipment for the best results.</p>
