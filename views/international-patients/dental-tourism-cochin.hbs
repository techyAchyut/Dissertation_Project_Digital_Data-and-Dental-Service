			<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #008000; font-size: 18pt;"><strong>Why <span style="color: #eba000;">Cochin?</span></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Kochi</b> (colonial name <b>Cochin</b>) is a vibrant city situated on the south-west coast of the Indian peninsula in the breathtakingly scenic and prosperous state of Kerala, hailed as &#8216;<i>God&#8217;s Own Country</i>&#8216;. Its strategic importance over the centuries is underlined by the sobriquet <b>Queen of the Arabian Sea</b>. Informally, Cochin is also referred to as the <b>Gateway to Kerala</b>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From time immemorial, the Arabs, British, Chinese, Dutch, and Portuguese have left indelible marks on the history and development of Cochin. Over the years, Cochin has emerged as the commercial and industrial capital of Kerala and is perhaps the second most important city on the west coast of India (after Mumbai/Bombay). Cochin is proud of its world class port and international airport that link it to many major cities worldwide.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This lovely seaside city is flanked by the Western Ghats on the east and the Arabian Sea on the west. Its proximity to the equator, the sea and the mountains provide a rich experience of a moderate equatorial climate.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Strictly speaking, Cochin is a small town. But, Cochin has outgrown its original bounds and is now the general name given to much of the region adjoining the original town, which now includes Cochin, Fort Kochi, Mattanchery, Ernakulam and many other nearby towns and villages. Cochin is situated in Ernakulam district in the state of Kerala. Ernakulam is also the name of a town &#8211; the administrative capital of Ernakulam district &#8211; but, for all practical purposes Ernakulam and Cochin, generally, refer to the same place.</p>
<p><strong>Kochi is the arguably the ideal starting point for exploring the unfathomable diversity and beauty of Kerala, rated in the top three tourist destinations by the World Travel &amp; Tourism Council and featured in National Geographic Traveler&#8217;s &#8217;50 greatest places of a lifetime&#8217;.</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The scenic backwaters of Kerala comprise serene stretches of lakes, canals and lagoons located parallel to the coast of the Arabian Sea. The backwater regions of Kerala are one of the most popular tourist destinations in the world. The tranquil backwater cruises are a once in a lifetime experience. Alappuzha, known as the &#8216;Venice of the East&#8217;, is especially popular for its houseboat cruises where you can soak in nature at its finest form.</p>
